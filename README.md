# SmartFallPreventor
This project focuses on creating a smart wearable system to prevent falls among elderly individuals. Using AI and sensors like the MPU6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope) and MAX30102 (heart rate and SpO2 monitor), the device tracks movement and vital signs in real time to detect falls and monitor health.
